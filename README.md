Machine learning code

A base version of functioning ML code
This base version is a single file with two machine learning methods for regression Random Forest [RF] Support Vector Machines [SVM] and a regression method Partial Least Squares [PLS]. The code is basic but functional. It takes as input a single csv file in the format:
