# ML-RF-SVM-PLS
Machine learning code

A base version of functioning ML code
This base version is a single file with three machine learning methods for regression Random Forest [RF] Support Vector Machines [SVM] and Partial Least Squares [PLS]. The code is basic and requires redefining into functions at the very least. It takes as input a single csv file in the format:

Names/Labels, Descriptor 1, Descriptor 2, Descriptor 3, ..... Target value

The output is three files 

A training file with information on the model training

A test file with a list of predictions and statistics in summary

A feature importance file from RF
